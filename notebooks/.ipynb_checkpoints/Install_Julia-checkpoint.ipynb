    "* You can add the executable to (Windows) system variables\n",
    "    * This will allow you to easily call Julia from Windows command prompt\n",
    "    * Go to `Control Panel >> System and Security >>System >> Advanced system settings >> Advanced >> Environment variables >> Path` and add folder containing Julia executable\n",
